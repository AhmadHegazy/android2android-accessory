this is as an example on how to do accessory mode between 2 Android devices. 
You connect 2 devices via one usb-cable + one usb-OTG adapter and chat between devices ( or exchange any other data in a real-world application ). Be aware that the direction of the cable matters even though there is micro-usb on both ends.
The App comes in 2 flavors - one host flavor and one device flavor. You need to install one of these flavors on each device.
